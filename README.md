# Parkinson-s-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

Description:

Welcome to the Parkinson's Disease Prediction project repository! Here, we present an advanced machine learning solution aimed at predicting Parkinson's disease using a diverse array of algorithms including Variable Size Algorithm (VSA), Random Neural Network Structural Adaptation (RNSA), High-Dimensional Neural Network Structural Adaptation (HDNSA), and Negative Selection Algorithm (NSA), alongside traditional methods such as Random Forest, Linear Regression, and Decision Trees. With over 10 different models utilized, this project offers a comprehensive approach to disease prediction.

Key Features:

Dataset Compilation: Curated datasets containing relevant medical features and labels for Parkinson's disease prediction are provided. These datasets are sourced from reputable healthcare repositories and research publications.

Data Preprocessing: The preprocessing pipeline involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization to ensure the quality and consistency of input data for machine learning models.

Model Development: Utilizing a variety of advanced algorithms including VSA, RNSA, HDNSA, and NSA, as well as traditional methods like Random Forest, Linear Regression, and Decision Trees, we develop a diverse set of predictive models for Parkinson's disease.

Model Evaluation: The performance of each disease prediction model is rigorously evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation techniques are employed to ensure robustness and generalizability of the models.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Hyperparameter tuning is conducted to optimize the performance of the models, utilizing techniques like grid search and random search to find the optimal set of hyperparameters for each algorithm.
